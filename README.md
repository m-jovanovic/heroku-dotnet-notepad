# Realtime Sticky Notes with SignalR and Heroku

This is a real-time, multi-user sticky notes application built with [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr) and deployed on Heroku. SignalR enables seamless, bidirectional communication between clients and the server, making it perfect for collaborative experiences. To support horizontal scaling, the app leverages Redis via the [Heroku Key-Value Store](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis) add-on, alongside [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) for persistent data storage. 

This app lets users create, edit, and move sticky notes collaboratively in real time across multiple browsers. Whether you're building collaborative tools or experimenting with SignalR and Heroku, this app serves as a fun and practical example of real-time web development in the .NET ecosystem.

## Local

You can run this application locallly without Postgres and Redis configured and it will use an in-memory service for SignalR and SQLite for storage. 

```
cd NotepadApp
dotnet run
```

If you want to attach Heroku Postgres and Heroku Key-Value Store run the following commands and restart the application.

```
heroku create
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0 --wait
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:mini --wait
heroku config --shell > .env
```

## Deploy

You can deploy this applicaiton without Postgres and Redis configured and it will use an in-memory service for SignalR and SQLite for storage. Click the Deploy to Heroku button or follow the commands below. 

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy)

Use the following commands to deploy from the command line:

```
heroku create
git push heroku main
```

The application should be functional at this point. To scale horizontally and store notes you must attach Heroku Postgres and Heroku Key-Value Store by running the following commands:

```
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:essential-0 --wait
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:mini --wait
```

SignalR requires ["sticky sessions"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/scale?view=aspnetcore-9.0#sticky-sessions) when running on multiple servers, so make sure to also enable the [Session Affinity](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/session-affinity#enable-session-affinity) feature when scaling horizontally:

```
heroku features:enable http-session-affinity
```
